# Alfapet
for dimensions calculator

Adam Johnes

The project is a proposed website that takes in the user's litterbox dimensions and matches the size of their litterbox to a specific Alfapet Inc. Liner size. This is being created so the customer may avoid ordering the improper size of liner of their size of litterbox.

How to use:
Enter your litterbox dimensions, measuring the length, width and heights of all sides. Submit. The calculator will output a proper liner for your size, if one exists.
