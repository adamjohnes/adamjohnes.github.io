# Alfapet
for dimensions calculator

Adam Johnes

The project is a website that takes in the user's litterbox dimensions and matches the size of their litterbox to a specific Alfapet Inc. Liner size. This has been created so the customer may avoid ordering the improper cat pan liner size that fails to match the size of their litterbox.

How to use:
Enter your litterbox dimensions, measuring the length, width and heights of all sides. Submit. The calculator will output a proper liner for your size, if one exists.
